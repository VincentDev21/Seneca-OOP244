In this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program that would prompt the
user to enter a name and extension in order to create a nametag. We were tasked to create
functions to check if user input was correct and create a function that would only accept
strings that are not over 40 characters long. I was able the learn the use of using the width()
function to correctly space characters. I found it very useful to use the width() function for 
formatting since before I used to use statements in order to create spaces between strings
which was not the most efficient way of formatting. The only issue I had with the workshop was making
sure that a user entered an integer and not a string or character. I found that to prevent an overflow
when users entered a character or string, we can use the clear() and ignore() functions in order to clear
the input buffer and ignore characters.
