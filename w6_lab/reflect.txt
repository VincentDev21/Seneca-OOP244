In this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program that would open a file
and sort a series of numbers from least to greatest and would tell us the total number of
numbers, the largest number, the smallest numbers, and the average between all the numbers.
This workshop was designed for us to work with constructors, one-argument constructors, 
insertion and extraction operators, and copy constructors and assignments. The assignment
was overall straightforward forward but the only issue I had was with the copy assignment. I had a
couple of issues with dynamically saving the information. I also had issues creating the load
function which requires us to use "ifstream" in order to read the file and save it to a dynamic
array. Overall the workshop allowed me to understand how to use copy constructors 
and copy assignments and how to use file functions to either read or write a file.
