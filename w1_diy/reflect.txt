*****************************************************************************
In this week's workshop, I was able to experience the new c++ library and learned
how similar the syntax is between c and c++. The task we were given was to open and 
read a file, sort the file by student number from least to greatest, print
the students and their GPA depending on the user input, and exit the program when
users enter '!'. This workshop really allowed me the refresh my memory of what I have
learnt in IPC144. I also had times in the workshop where I had a couple of errors when submitting
the workshop through the matrix which gave me errors about uninitialized variables and memory leaks.
I had the most trouble deallocating my memory since I didn't realize that I have opened the file
from 2 separate functions which caused me to need to use the delete [] operator in 2 separate functions.
I have resolved that issue and have allowed me the grasp a basic understanding of c++ and its library.
