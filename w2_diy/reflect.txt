For this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program that would read 
a file that contains the behavioral profiles using Android applications using 
specific instructions. We were also tasked to create a program that would take a 
user's input and hold the user information and repeated until the user enters nothing.
Throughout the workshop, I was able to experience the use of memory allocation,
dynamic arrays and function overloads. The use of dynamic arrays helped me 
understand the basics of memory allocation and how versatile it can be. 
This workshop also allowed me to really understand the use of function overloads and passing 
values through the overloads via reference. I also had some troubles in the workshop when it came to
passing by values through the overloads that we were tasked to create. I had trouble calling the overloads 
in order to store the values in the file. I have resolved the issue and I understand how overloads work now.
