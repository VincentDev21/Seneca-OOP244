*****************************************************************************
In this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program that would allow 
users to create a virtual pet and charge the user depending on the number
of times to feed, or either clone or create a pet. This program would also show 
the pet's life expectancy depending on how the user treats it. The purpose of 
this workshop is for us to learn how to inherit different classes in order for different
classes to work with each other, we also learned how to override different methods
from the base class if needed depending on the implementation. This workshop was rather 
pretty straight forward and the only issue I had was inheriting both the dog and pet 
constructor. After overcoming that hurdle the rest of the workshop seemed pretty easy.
