In this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program to print 
a bus depending on the user's input. It would size the bus according to the number of seats
the user declared and the number is occupied seats. I was able to have an understanding of using
the overload operators in order either add or subtract the current object that is currently getting
passed. I also learned how to use overload binary member operators to add one part of a 
structure array to another.
