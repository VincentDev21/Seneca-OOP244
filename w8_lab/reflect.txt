For this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program that would help us understand how to use Virtual Functions and Abstract base classes. This workshop allowed me to grasp a basic understanding of how to utilize virtual functions and abstract classes and the different ways you can implement them. The workshop did seem pretty tricky at first since I wasn't familiar with the concept and had issues with referencing the virtual functions in the classes that inherited the "Media" class. Overall this workshop helped me understand what virtual functions and abstract base classes are and how to implement them into my code.
